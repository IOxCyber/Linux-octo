### Linux: Open source, CLI based OS.
- In 1991, graduate student Linus Torvalds developed a UNIX-like kernel that he named Linux, and licensed it as open source software under the GPL
- Open source software is software with source code that anyone can use, study, modify, and share.
- Open source has many benefits for the user such as `Control, Implement real world Security, Stability & Stability`
- 2 types of copyrights for OSS are `1. Copyleft licenses[^1] 2. Permissive licenses[^2]`
- Developers of Open Source Software `By professional & Volunteers and the academic community`
- `A Linux distribution provides an easy method` to install and manage a working Linux system eg. Ubuntu, debian, RedHat RHEL, Kali Linux, Fedora, Parrot OS etc.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
- `Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)` is Red Hat's production-ready, commercially supported Linux distribution. 
- `RHEL CoreOS (RHCOS)` is not a stand-alone operating system, but it is built from RHEL components, and is then released, upgraded, and managed as part of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) for cloud-native applications.
- `Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)` is essentially a freely redistributable derivative of RHEL
- `RHEL for Edge` is an image-based variant of RHEL, with a different deployment mechanism. RHEL provides the ability to create purpose-built operating system images through a tool called Image Builder.
