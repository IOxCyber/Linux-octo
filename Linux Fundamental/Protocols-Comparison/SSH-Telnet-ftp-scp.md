     ```

2. **Telnet**:

     ```
   - **Use Case Example**: Connect to a remote device over an unencrypted connection:

     ```

3. **SCP (Secure Copy)**:
   - **Definition**: `For securely copying files between a local and a remote host or between two remote hosts using ssh`
   - **Basic Syntax**:

     ```

4. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**:
   - **Definition**: `Used for transferring files between a client and a server over an unencrypted connection.`
   - **Basic Syntax**: FTP uses an interactive command-line interface.
