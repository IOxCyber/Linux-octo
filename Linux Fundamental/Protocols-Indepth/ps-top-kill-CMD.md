## Manually Gnome Task Manager:
- GUI supported in different distro.
- `gnome-system-monitor` or `ksysguard`

## Viewing Static Processes: `ps`
- `Running a command results in something called a process, Every process run with user's privileges.`
- Users who have administrative privileges can control any user processes, including stopping any user process.

- The `ps -e & -f or aux` option will display every process & more verbose details

> When you run the ps -e command in Linux to display information about all processes, you may see a "?" in the TTY column for certain processes. This indicates that the process is not associated with any specific terminal or console.
```
Also,

1. Background Processes: Processes running in the background, such as daemons or system services, typically do not have a controlling terminal and appear as "?" in the TTY column.
2. Kernel Threads: Certain kernel threads and system processes do not have a user-associated terminal and are shown with a "?" in the TTY column.
3. Zombie Processes: Zombie processes, which are terminated but still present in the process table, may also appear with a "?" in the TTY column.
4. Non-Interactive Sessions: Processes spawned by system scripts or cron jobs, which run in non-interactive sessions, may not have a TTY associated with them.
5. Processes without Terminal Access: Processes initiated by system services or background tasks that do not require terminal access may also have a "?" in the TTY column.

```

## Viewing Dynamic/Real-Time Processes: `top` `htop`


## To Kill a Process:
- In Linux, you can end a process using the `kill` command or its variants. Here's how to do it:

1. **Using `kill` with PID**:
   - First, you need to find the Process ID (PID) of the process you want to end. You can use the `ps` command to list all processes and find the PID of the process you want to terminate.
     ```
     ps -aux | grep <process_name>
     ```
   - Once you have the PID, you can use the `kill` command followed by the PID to terminate the process. For example, to terminate a process with PID 1234:
     ```
     kill 1234
     ```

2. **Using `pkill` with Process Name**:
   - If you know the name of the process you want to terminate but not its PID, you can use the `pkill` command followed by the process name to terminate all processes with that name. For example, to terminate all processes named "firefox":
     ```
     pkill firefox
     ```

3. **Using `killall` with Process Name**:
   - Similar to `pkill`, you can also use the `killall` command followed by the process name to terminate all processes with that name. For example, to terminate all processes named "firefox":
     ```
     killall firefox
     ```

4. **Using `kill` with Signals**:
   - By default, the `kill` command sends the TERM signal to the process, asking it to terminate gracefully. If the process does not respond to the TERM signal, you can use other signals such as KILL or HUP. For example:
     ```
     kill -9 1234  # Sends the KILL signal to PID 1234
     ```
```
Common signals include:
SIGKILL (9): Terminate the process immediately. Cannot be caught or ignored.
SIGTERM (15): Terminate the process gracefully. Can be caught or ignored to perform cleanup tasks before termination.
SIGSTOP (19): Suspend (pause) the process temporarily. Cannot be caught or ignored.
SIGCONT (18): Resume (unpause) the process after it has been stopped.
SIGINT (2): Interrupt signal, typically generated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.
```


5. **Using `xkill` (Graphical)**:
   - If you are using a graphical desktop environment, you can use the `xkill` command to terminate a process by clicking on its window. Simply run `xkill` in a terminal, and your cursor will change to an "X" symbol. Click on the window of the process you want to terminate, and it will be ended.
