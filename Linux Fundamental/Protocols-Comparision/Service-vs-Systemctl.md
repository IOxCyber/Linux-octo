1. **`service` Command**:
   - The `service` command is a `legacy command used for managing system services` on Linux systems. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the status of services.
   - It is commonly `used on older Linux` distributions or distributions that use the System V (SysV) init system.
   - Examples:
     - Start a service: `sudo service apache2 start`
     - Stop a service: `sudo service apache2 stop`
     - Restart a service: `sudo service apache2 restart`
     - Check the status of a service: `sudo service apache2 status`

2. **`systemctl` Command**:
   - The `systemctl` command is a `more modern and feature-rich command used for managing system services` on Linux systems that use the systemd init system.
   - It is the standard command for managing services on newer Linux distributions such as Ubuntu 16.04 and later, CentOS 7 and later, and Debian 8 and later.
   - Examples:
     - Start a service: `sudo systemctl start apache2`
     - Stop a service: `sudo systemctl stop apache2`
     - Restart a service: `sudo systemctl restart apache2`
     - Check the status of a service: `sudo systemctl status apache2`

3. **Key Differences**:
   - **Syntax**: The syntax for using `service` and `systemctl` commands differs. `service` typically uses `service <service-name> <action>`, while `systemctl` uses `systemctl <action> <service-name>`.
   - **Features**: `systemctl` offers more features and functionality compared to `service`. It provides better integration with systemd and offers additional options for service management, such as enabling/disabling services, checking dependencies, and managing unit files.
   - **Compatibility**: `systemctl` is not universally available on all Linux distributions, especially older ones that do not use systemd. In such cases, `service` may still be used for managing services.
   - **Logging**: `systemctl` provides better logging and control of services compared to `service`, allowing for more detailed monitoring and troubleshooting.
